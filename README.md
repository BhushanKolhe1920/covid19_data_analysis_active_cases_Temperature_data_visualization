# covid19_data_analysis_active_cases_Temperature_data_visualization

This data is used for educational purpose only however in order to get actual conclusion we need huge and correct data.

Language used : Python3.8
Software used : Jupyter Notebook -- Anaconda3
Project : Covid19 Data Analysis using data science concepts.

# How to install Jupyter notebook in your system

1. Install latest version of python ''' https://www.python.org/downloads/ '''
2. Now we need to install Anaconda Navigator. Go to this link and download Anaconda3 w.r.t system OS.
 '''
 https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
 '''
 3. We can search Jupyter notebook in start menu and Start Anaconda 3 Terminal.
 4. You will be redireected towards Jupyter notebook on your Google Chrome.  

Source of datasets : 
1. Covid 19 data : ''' https://www.covid19india.org '''
2. Temperature data : ''' https://www.accuweather.com/en/in/mumbai/204842/january-weather/204842 '''
3. Covid active case data : ''' https://prsindia.org/covid-19/cases '''

#### In order to install various libraries we can use following command :

'''
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib.pyplot
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn
...
'''

# Getting stated with Jupyter Notebook : 
- Open Anaconda3 Terminal which will redirect itself to Jupyter notebook.
- Once Juypter notebook is opened Click on New  -->  Python3  -->  Python file will be created.
- We can write our code in provided cells.

# Only For educational learnings this project is created.

From this educational data, we can conclude that 
#### 1. In Maharashtra region, decrease in covid cases and decrease in temperature  Both are parallel
#### 2. In Kerala region, Decrease in covid cases and at  same time we can see rise in temperature
#### 3. In Punjab region, we can see two to three spikes where temperature is increasing and covid cases are decreasing.
#### 4. In West Bengal region , we can see fall in temperature but spike in covid cases.

#### Hence rise and fall in temperature is sometime related to active cases increment. But it is not linear as we can see in above graphs.
#### From above data we can conclude that temperature cannont be major factor for incrase or decrease in covid cases.
#### However from biological study, temperature of human body is related to covid test.
